This is the first project that team 2207 has used their new "lib" file system. 
Aimed to make code easier to produce faster, this code can be uploaded to 
future projects to get a jumpstart on the process towards more advanced code.

This includes:
Swerve drive code for Spark Flex and Spark Max
Three motor controller 3 classes with specialized methods compatible with Spark Flex and Spark Max
Extensive LED code
Multiple additional files to enhance the code such as auto positioning, robust controls
